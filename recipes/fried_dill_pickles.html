    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pickles are my pride and joy, I love this recipe and I'm sure you will too!</p>
    <p>These aren't your average pickles, they're Uncle Tom's Farm Famous Pickles. I've been developing this recipe to perfection since I was a young boy when the sacred pickle recipe was passed onto me from a long line of pickle farmers. One taste of this delicious brined cucumber and you may lose touch with reality. Something I call "Pickle Hysteria" and it only comes from MY pickles. They're <em>THAT</em> good!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) jar sliced dill pickles, drained</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the egg, milk, 1 tablespoon of flour, and Worcestershire sauce. In a separate bowl, stir together the remaining flour, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep-fryer or heavy deep skillet. Dip pickle slices into the milk mixture, then into the flour mixture. Repeat dipping.</li>
        <li>Place the pickles carefully into the hot oil. Avoid over crowding by frying in several batches. Fry until pickles float to the surface, and are golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels.</li>
