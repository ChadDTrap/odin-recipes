        <li>1/2 cup plus 1/3cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
        <li> 6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup whipping cream, chilled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and position rack in center of oven. Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper and coat parchment with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, mix together oil and butter. Mix in 1/2 cup white sugar and the brown sugar until well combined. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well to incorporate and scraping bowl well after each addition. Mix in 2 teaspoons vanilla.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan and spread in an even layer. Stir together remaining 1/3 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly over batter. Wash and dry stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment.</li>
        <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>For frosting, in bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat cream cheese at medium speed 1 minute. Add powdered sugar and beat at medium speed until well combined. Scrape bowl well.</li>
        <li>With mixer running at medium-low speed, add cream and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla in a slow, steady stream. Gradually increase speed to medium-high and beat to medium peaks, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Fit a disposable pastry bag with a large round or star tip (about 1/4-inch wide). Fill bag with frosting.</li>
        <li>Run a small offset spatula or a knife around outside of cake and gently invert onto a cutting board. Remove parchment paper. Cut into 9 squares.</li>
        <li>Pipe frosting onto each cake piece: Starting at one corner of a square, pipe zigzag diagonally, ending at opposite corner. Repeat with remaining squares. Garnish with cinnamon. Chill in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 4 days.</li>
    </ol>
